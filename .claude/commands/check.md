Quality gate before `/ship`. Checks 5 categories: code quality, API standards, tests, backend verification, documentation.

Usage: `/check [scope?]`
- Omitted: full verification (all 5 categories)
- `--quick`: Hard Gate only (typecheck + lint + build)
- `--api`: API/Edge Function standards only
- `--test`: Test standards only

## Core Principles

> "ran without errors" ≠ "correct" — do NOT assume correctness from build pass alone.
> Hard Gate failure blocks `/ship`. Soft Gate warnings are displayed only.

## Gate Rules

| Type | On failure | Applies to |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Hard Gate** | Blocks /ship, MUST fix and re-run | Category 1 (code quality) |
| **Soft Gate** | /ship allowed, warning list displayed | Categories 2-5 |

## Verification Categories

### 1. Code Quality (Hard Gate — ANY failure blocks /ship)

```bash
# 1a. Backend type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# 1b. Frontend type check
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit

# 1c. ESLint
npm run lint

# 1d. Unit tests (if configured)
npm test 2>/dev/null || echo "no tests configured"

# 1e. Vite build
cd frontend && npm run build

# 1f. Hardcode/fragmentation audit
npx tsx scripts/audit/hardcode-audit.ts
```

ALL items MUST pass for Hard Gate PASS. Audit baseline at `reports/hardcode-audit/baseline.json` ratchets down only.

### 2. API/Edge Function Standards (Soft Gate)

Detect API routes or Edge Functions among changed files:
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | grep -E '(src/api/|supabase/functions/)'
```

For detected files, check:
- Error responses are structured (`{ status, code, message }` pattern)
- Success responses follow standard format (`{ status, data }` pattern)
- **[G6] Fail Loudly**: business errors (LIMIT_EXCEEDED, NOT_FOUND, ALREADY_EXISTS, etc.) return explicit error codes
- try-catch blocks do NOT silently swallow errors

### 3. Test Standards (Soft Gate)

- Tests exist for changed code (same directory or under `tests/`)
- **[G8] E2E verification**: Playwright tests cover the changed UI
- If `tests/TEST.md` exists, it reflects latest results

### 4. Backend Verification (Soft Gate)

**[G1] Real Backend + [G3] Output Verification**:
- DB schema changes: `npx prisma generate` success + local `npx prisma db push` success confirmed
- Edge Function changes: verify via curl with actual call (dev environment)
- **[G5] Idempotency**: same API call twice produces no side effects
- **[G2] Rendering Gap**: changed fields propagated across full L0-L6 path
  - DB schema (L0) → Edge Function (L1) → Type definition (L2) → Converter (L3) → Hook (L4) → UI (L6)

### 5. Documentation Standards (Soft Gate)

- Whether CLAUDE.md needs updating (if core rules changed)
- Whether commit messages can include related Issue numbers
- Documentation exists for changed Edge Functions/APIs

### 6. Runtime Risk Patterns (Soft Gate — promoted from troubleshooting.md LEVEL-2)

Known repeat-offense patterns. Check changed files for these risks. If any match, require explicit ack before /ship.

**[6a] tsc pass ≠ runtime safe**
- Trigger: any FE change touching navigate/mutation lifecycle, or BE plugin loading.
- Check: `/verify` must include browser smoke (npm run dev + curl / UI click path). tsc alone is insufficient.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "tsc pass ≠ runtime safe" (PR #403/#404 reverts).

**[6b] Fastify plugin version constraint**
- Trigger: `src/api/plugins/*.ts` changed, or new fp() wrapper added.
- Check: fp() `fastify` constraint matches `package.json` installed version (grep fastify version).
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "fp() fastify version must match" (PR #408 revert).

**[6c] navigate() before mutate()**
- Trigger: `useMutation` + `navigate()` in same handler (FE).
- Check: navigate runs in onSuccess/after await, NOT before mutation dispatch. Unmount kills onSuccess silently.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "navigate() before mutate() = unmount kills onSuccess" (PR #404 revert).

**[6d] Global rate limit bucket**
- Trigger: changes to `src/api/plugins/rate-limit*`, `server.ts` rate config, or any endpoint with user-facing write.
- Check: method/endpoint scope separated (GET vs POST distinct buckets). Write bucket sized for burst (≥ expected max concurrent click count).
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "Global rate limit bucket = service death" (15min outage PR #408 → #407/#409 fix).

**[6e] Dead code before write**
- Trigger: NEW file under `src/api/plugins/`, `src/modules/*/`, or FE `frontend/src/features/*/`.
- Check: Grep for existing implementation of same concept before writing new.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "Dead code in codebase" (rate-limit.ts 7일 dead code).

**[6f] Docker healthcheck localhost**
- Trigger: `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose*.yml` changes adding/editing healthcheck.
- Check: healthcheck URL uses `127.0.0.1` not `localhost` (IPv6 resolution on Alpine).
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "Alpine wget resolves localhost to IPv6 first".

**[6g] API response contract change without consumer grep**
- Trigger: change to any response shape / threshold / throw in `src/api/routes/`, `src/modules/`, `supabase/functions/`.
- Check: `grep -rn "<endpoint-or-type>"` across FE (`frontend/src/`) to enumerate consumers; each validated.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "API 응답 계약 변경 시 consumer validation grep 필수" (CP415 PR #444 `totalActions < 64 throw` empty-actions fallout).

**[6h] PWA autoUpdate activates flag-gated dead code**
- Trigger: `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` or any `workbox`/`vite-plugin-pwa` config change.
- Check: No flag-gated view component is left in `src/` that autoUpdate could resurrect on client cache bust. Verify by grep for unreferenced route / feature flag guards.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "PWA autoUpdate flag-gated dead-code" (CP415 PR #441 `MandalaWizardStreamView` user stranded).

**[6i] docker-compose environment: overrides env_file**
- Trigger: `docker-compose*.yml` `environment:` block edit OR `.env` value change for a key referenced in that block.
- Check: Both `environment:` block AND `.env` / CI `deploy.yml` sed step updated in same PR. `docker exec <c> printenv <KEY>` verifies post-deploy.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "docker-compose env override silent miss" (CP416 `V3_CENTER_GATE_MODE` 2-layer flip).

**[6j] Partial-info verification (head-N / grep 1-line / snapshot 단일시점 / Edit partial-match)**
- Trigger: any Edit whose `old_string` is a substring rather than a unique anchor; any judgment based on `head -N` / single-line `grep` / single probe.
- Check: `old_string` `grep -c` returns 1; judgment surfaces full block context (10-20 surrounding lines); time-dependent signals re-measured at ≥ 2 timestamps.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md Regression Watchlist "Partial-info verification" (CP421 5× session-internal recurrence; counter=2).

**[6k] Prod manual edit silent revert**
- Trigger: any `ssh insighta-ec2 sed/patch/docker-compose edit` operation on `/opt/tubearchive/` that was not also committed to the repo.
- Check: Same change committed in `docker-compose.prod.yml` (or equivalent) on a branch that lands before next Deploy; otherwise flag as will-revert.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "Prod manual edit silently reverted by next deploy" (CP419 `V3_CENTER_GATE_MODE=subword` double regression).

**[6l] Deploy Copy compose step overwrites prod**
- Trigger: `deploy.yml` change touching `Copy docker-compose.prod.yml to EC2` or any `scp`/`rsync` targeting `/opt/tubearchive/docker-compose*.yml`.
- Check: Repo version is source-of-truth; any intentional prod-only divergence must be moved to env var indirection (not docker-compose literal).
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "Deploy Copy docker-compose.prod.yml to EC2 step overwrites prod compose" (CP419 regression).

**[6m] Bulk UPDATE/reset column-scope matrix not presented**
- Trigger: any script or query that runs `UPDATE ... SET <col> = NULL` (or DELETE) on ≥ 50 rows of a user-data table.
- Check: Pre-flight produced a per-column matrix (오염/살릴 수 있음/액션) presented to the user AND latest daily backup timestamp was confirmed (`s3://insighta-backups/db/YYYY/MM/`) AND a 1-10 row sample commit was verified before full commit.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "CP438+2: Reset/destructive bulk UPDATE 컬럼별 scope 미제시" (LEVEL-2 fast-track, 590 row NULL incident with `lora.qa_pairs` self-contradiction; 19 row permanent loss; 564/583 partial recovery from S3).

**[6n] SQL/ORM JOIN cardinality not row-count-diff verified**
- Trigger: any PR touching SQL or Prisma `select` / `where` / `from` with a JOIN/INNER JOIN/LEFT JOIN clause change.
- Check: `COUNT(*)` for left-table / matched / left-only / right-only computed AND the cardinality model (1:1 / 1:N / N:M) is explicitly stated in the PR description; `ship` blocked if expected vs actual diff exceeds modeled boundary.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md Regression Watchlist "Selector/JOIN 변경 → prod row count diff 사전 측정" (LEVEL-2, counter=2, CP438 INNER JOIN 6th recurrence; 5462 video unblock by LEFT JOIN fix in PR #593).

**[6o] macOS shell awk dialect (BSD vs gawk) compat**
- Trigger: any shell script using `awk match($0, /pattern/, m)` 3-argument form, or `gensub` / `gawk` extensions, intended to run on macOS Mac Mini or BSD systems.
- Check: POSIX-only awk (`split` + `sub` 2-argument form) used; `shellcheck` does NOT lint awk dialects, so manual review + 1 smoke run on the actual target host required.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "CP439: macOS gawk→BSD awk 3-arg match() silent fail" (LEVEL-1, 25/25 batch silent failure on Mac Mini, awk syntax error swallowed).

**[6p] Subprocess wrapping OAuth/limit pre-grep before mark_attempted**
- Trigger: any subprocess wrapper (e.g., `claude -p`, `gh api`) where the parent script `jq`/`mark_attempted` stamps the response without first checking for OAuth/limit error strings (`hit your limit`, `Not logged in`, `resets [0-9]`).
- Check: error-string grep precedes any success/failure stamping; OAuth/limit responses produce a distinct exit code (e.g., exit 4 oauth, exit 5 limit) and a sentinel file (`.oauth_limit_hit`) so cooldown locks are NOT applied to videos that were never actually attempted.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "CP439: claude -p OAuth/limit 응답이 mark_attempted 도장 → 7-day cooldown poison" (LEVEL-1, 81 social-domain candidates 7-day locked without ever being attempted; PR #606 fix `f61ad69`).

**[6q] Native HTML5 image-drag suppression in dnd-kit zones**
- Trigger: any new card/list component using `dnd-kit` with `<img>` or `data:`/`blob:` thumbnail.
- Check: `<img draggable={false}>` set OR `onDragStart={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` applied; otherwise native HTML5 drag fires in parallel with dnd-kit, surfacing false invalid-URL toasts and breaking sort.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "CP443: native HTML5 image drag fires alongside dnd-kit" (LEVEL-1, false invalid-URL toast user-visible).

**[6r] Outside-click handler `mousedown` race in dnd-kit context**
- Trigger: any popover/menu/tooltip with outside-click close inside (or adjacent to) a dnd-kit container.
- Check: outside-click uses `click` event (not `mousedown`); `mousedown` race fires close before dnd-kit can register drag start, breaking drag interaction or losing focus mid-drag.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "CP446: idea-spot mousedown→click race fix" (commit `8cc1db8`).

**[6s] Layout root background-color explicit on chrome restructure**
- Trigger: any sidebar/chrome layout restructure that unifies `--sidebar-background` with `--background`, or removes a previously-relied-on bg variable.
- Check: component root explicitly sets `bg-*` class; `border-r` alone is insufficient when bg is unified — collapsed sidebar appears to vanish without explicit bg, masking actual presence.
- Reference: troubleshooting.md "CP441: Layout 변경 시 background-color 명시 누락" (LEVEL-1, user image catch).

Promotion policy: an item is added here when it appears in troubleshooting.md at LEVEL-2+, OR at LEVEL-1 with high prod impact (user frustration / outage / data corruption). Items retired when counter drops or pattern becomes impossible by design.
